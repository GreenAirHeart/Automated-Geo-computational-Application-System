# Automated Geo-computational Application System
Geo-computation is an important method for geographical research and application. Due to the different computing tasks, the models and data required for geo-computations also differ significantly. Moreover, with the development of research and applications on global change, sustainable development, and others, geo-computations have become increasingly complex, with larger spatiotemporal scales, and higher requirements for spatiotemporal accuracy. Therefore, when processing geo-computations, it's a great challenge for users (especially for novices) to determine suitable geospatial models and match suitable geospatial data. The model selection and data matching require expert knowledge.
