# Automated Geo-computational Application System
Geo-computation is an important method for geographical research and application. Due to the different computing tasks, the models and data required for geo-computations also differ significantly. Moreover, with the development of research and applications on global change, sustainable development, and others, geo-computations have become increasingly complex, with larger spatiotemporal scales, and higher requirements for spatiotemporal accuracy. Therefore, when processing geo-computations, it's a great challenge for users (especially for novices) to determine suitable geospatial models and match suitable geospatial data because model selection and data matching require expert knowledge.

To deal with the above-mentioned shortcoming, we utilize a fusion of computational and expert knowledge in the knowledge graph. By integrating geo-computations with expert knowledge through the framework of a knowledge graph, the procedures of geo-computations, including the selection of appropriate geospatial models and the matching of geospatial data, can be automated. Here, to enhance user accessibility and efficiency, an automated geo-computational application system empowered by knowledge graphs is designed. Through this system, the automated selection of geospatial models is facilitated, alongside the seamless matching and processing of geospatial data tailored to the specific requirements of geospatial computing tasks and model inputs.

The system comprises four distinct components: 'application setting', 'model selecting', 'data matching', and 'results display'.

In the 'application setting' (Figure 1), the user needs to select the application task, study area, and resolution (all of these characteristics are necessary as defined in the geo-computation ontology). For example, choose "Basic Morphological Classification" as the application task. When selecting a study area, the user can draw a rectangle or enter the coordinates of the study area (top right and bottom left coordinates) to determine the study area. The resolution here is spatial, with multiple options for resolution (in meters). A resolution of 90m is selected in Figure 1. ![system1](https://github.com/GreenAirHeart/Automated-Geo-computational-Application-System/assets/167099838/80a69608-ff7b-40c8-827d-1d1c053d10f4) Figure 1 Application Setting

In the 'model selecting' (Figure 2), according to the user's selection in the 'application setting', the application input box displays the user's application setting, including application task, region, and resolution. Users can also click the "Upload" button to upload the knowledge graph. After clicking the "Model Query" button, the matching result box will display the Models and Workflow automatically matched to process the task defined in the user's previous custom application settings. ![system2](https://github.com/GreenAirHeart/Automated-Geo-computational-Application-System/assets/167099838/b080cdbf-2e61-4af6-a43a-f4b1fb23d5ca) Figure 2 Model Selecting

In the 'data matching' (Figure 3), the user is provided with two options. The first option is that the system will automatically recommend data sets to the user based on application settings and model selection. The system scores the recommended datasets and provides an introduction to each dataset. The higher the score obtained for the dataset, the better the dataset matches the application task and model requirements. For example, as shown in Figure 3, the first recommended data is "STRM_90" and the dataset receives a score of "0.78904". Users can click the small box before the data name to check it. For the second option, if the user does not select the recommended dataset, the data can be uploaded. Users can click the small box in front of "Please Upload Your Data" to check and enter the data upload mode. The user can Upload the Data after clicking the "upload" button. After uploading the data, the system will verify the uploaded data, and the "Data Validation Result" box will display the verification information and the verification result. If the verification results show that the uploaded data is valid, the user can continue processing. If the verification results show that some aspect of the uploaded data does not meet the application task and model requirements, the user needs to re-upload the data until the verification results are valid.![system3](https://github.com/GreenAirHeart/Automated-Geo-computational-Application-System/assets/167099838/84bcc133-8a77-4b8d-b40f-de3525cada3e) Figure 3 Data Matching

In the 'results display' part (Figure 4), the user can see the information of the selected application task and data before executing the task. Click the "Run" button to execute the task, and when the message box shows "Action Finished", users can click the "Preview" button to enter the result preview window and view the result (Figure 5). If the user is satisfied with the result, click the "Download" button to download the result. ![system4](https://github.com/GreenAirHeart/Automated-Geo-computational-Application-System/assets/167099838/4a4db5b8-9472-471d-a10a-e23f91b6d743) Figure 4 Results Display
